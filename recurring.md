## Recurring Academic Support

So you're thinking about setting up a recurring weekly remote academic support session with me for Fall 2020? **Great!** 

In this document, I'll lay out how recurring sessions with me will work this year. There are two things to consider:

1. The one-time process of setting up a recurring session
2. The week-to-week experience

### 1. Setting Up a Recurring Session With Me

If there's a time every week (Sundays from 1-2pm, Thursdays from 7-9pm, etc.) when you're interested in working with me, you're likely a strong candidate for a recurring session.

Let's discuss your situation so that I can learn more about your needs and schedule. I can't promise that I'll be available at your first choice of time, but I'm starting the 2020-2021 year with more than 30 hours of potential tutoring time set aside each week, so hopefully we can find something that works for everyone!

If you've worked with me before, please send me a text message so that we can coordinate a time to discuss what you have in mind.

If you've never worked with me before, please [send me an email](mailto:ftlaudmathtutor@gmail.com) with a brief description of your situation and we can take things from there.

Setting up our recurring session should be a one-time process - that's the whole point! Once we've discussed your situation and found a time that will work for both of us, let's look at how things will work week-to-week.

### 2. The Week-to-Week Experience

As I discussed in my Fall 2020 update, I'll be using a web-based scheduling service called Appointlet to manage all my academic support sessions this year. [My Appointlet page](https://hamilton.appointlet.com) will provide everyone with up-to-date information about my availability. And Appointlet will let *you* manage your tutoring sessions without needing to wait for me.

After we've found a time that will work for our recurring session(s) each week, I'll enter that information into Appointlet.

On Monday of each week, you'll receive confirmation emails from Appointlet for your recurring session(s) for the **following** week (8-13 days ahead). These emails will include calendar events, a link to the Zoom meeting for the session(s), and a summary of the meeting times.

If you're only interested in having your recurring session for the following week, then you're good to go! That was easy.

If you'd like to make some changes to the plan for the following week, you can do that too. Here's how:

#### Change: Cancel a Session

If next week looks like an easy one and your usual session won't be necessary, Appointlet makes it easy to cancel.

#### Change: Reschedule a Session

If your usual time won't work but you'd like to have a session of the same duration at a different time, Appointlet makes it easy to reschedule.

#### Change: Add More Time to Your Session

Adding more time to your usual session may or may not be possible, depending on whether or not students have booked sessions on either side of your usual time.

Thankfully, you don't need to wait to hear back from me about my availability! Just:

* Head over to [my Appointlet page](https://hamilton.appointlet.com)
* Select the duration of **additional time** you'd like to add (there's even a "30-minute Session Extension" for exactly this situation!)
* Check to see if I'm available on either side of your existing session

If I am, great - book it! You'll receive a separate confirmation email from Appointlet (so that you can reschedule/cancel this extension later if the situation changes again), and you should be all set.

If you don't see any availability on either side of your existing session, then adding more time to your existing session won't be possible. Please consider returning to Step 1 of the Appointlet booking process and booking a separate session for your additional needs.

#### Change: Book An Additional Session For Next Week

Busy week coming up? Test on Friday? More time with Hamilton would help? No problem!

Just head over to [my Appointlet page](https://hamilton.appointlet.com) and book yourself another session! You'll receive a separate confirmation email from Appointlet that will let you manage this session, totally independently of your recurring session.

**Please note** that all of these changes are subject to my scheduling policies and expectations for next year:

### Scheduling Policies and Expectations

# Ideas

Perk for recurring clients. Two weeks before final exams begin, I'll make a bunch of hours available through the end of final exams. I'll let you know ahead of time at exactly what time those are going to go live, so you can take your pick.

I can avoid the awkward "session requested" step that would happen if I did the booking myself via the current Session types by creating a separate set of sessions that don't have "Public" checked and that don't require manual approval. Then every Monday, I just run through these for everyone and we're good to go.

# Cut Stuff

As you hopefully read in my [Fall 2020 update](TODO: link), I'll be tutoring 100% remotely this year. Working remotely (eliminating travel time, traffic considerations, etc.) means that scheduling can be made much simpler and more transparent for everyone.
