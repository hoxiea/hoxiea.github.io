  last-minute booking requests this year because of the increased demands on my
  time and attention as a Master's student - please plan ahead and then take your pick!</li>

  least 48 hours away, free of charge.</li>

          At this point, I will have organized my personal, professional, and
  educational lives to give you my undivided attention and expertise at the time you
  requested. In exchange, you'll be responsible for the full cost of the session
  you booked, whether the student is able to attend or not.
