I've been tutoring math consistently since 2007. I always enjoyed it, and seemed to have a knack for helping other people understand mathematical ideas.

When I was looking for something to do after leaving Berkeley, I founded an elite tutoring company to help busy, success-oriented students succeed with math. For more information, check out the main page [here](http://ftlaudmathtutor.com/).
