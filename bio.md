I was born at a very young age in Lowell, MA. Quite the jet-setter in my youth, I moved to Miami Beach when I was one and then to Fort Lauderdale when I was two. Pleased with the balmy weather and my proximity to the Las Olas beach, I hunkered down in South Florida for the long haul.

Year Three of my life is a mystery. When I was four, I enrolled at [Pine Crest School](https://www.pinecrest.edu/), where I hung out for the next fourteen years. Pine Crest was an incredible place that connected me with wonderfully smart friends, dedicated teachers, and the opportunity to develop great work habits, communication skills, and intellectual curiosity.

In fourth grade, all my friends joined the school's concert band without telling me (thanks, guys). When I decided to join a couple weeks later, all the cool instruments were taken - I had to choose between the trombone, French horn, and tuba. While weighing my options, my father leaned over and whispered, “Pick the slidey one!” And with that now-famous piece of advice, my career as a trombonist was born.

I turned out to have some talent for music. Over the next nine years, I was fortunate enough to perform in a variety of settings: [New England Music Camp](https://snowpond.org/nemc/), [Interlochen](http://www.interlochen.org/), the Florida Youth Orchestra, the [Ars Flores Chamber Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_Flores_Symphony_Orchestra), the Sunrise Symphonic Pops Orchestra, multiple Florida All-State bands, and various Pine Crest music groups. Notable conductors I performed with include [Frederick Fennell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Fennell), [James Judd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Judd), and [Thomas Sleeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sleeper). And yes, I made it to Carnegie Hall. How? Practice! (And belong to the Florida Youth Orchestra during the 2001-2002 season.)

I graduated from Pine Crest in 2005 and accepted the [Trustee Scholarship](https://www.bu.edu/admissions/tuition-aid/scholarships-financial-aid/first-year-merit/trustee/) from [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/). After dabbling in chemistry, biology, economics, and computer science, I took a statistics course and liked what I saw. I ended up completing the math department's combined [BA/MA degree program](https://www.bu.edu/math/undergraduate/ba-ma/), graduating Phi Beta Kappa with two statistics degrees in four years. I was graciously awarded the College Prize for Excellence in Statistics by the mathematics department faculty, and even gave the student speech at the graduation ceremony.

After working for fifteen months as a statistical geneticist and R programmer at [Biogen Idec](https://www.biogen.com/), I headed west to California, to start a PhD in [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/index.html)'s [statistics department](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/) in 2010. I completed two years of coursework before deciding that a Ph.D. in Statistics wasn't for me, as much as I loved Berkeley and the Bay Area.

In 2012, I moved back to sunny South Florida to figure out what *was* for me. I took a bunch of online courses related to computer science, programming, and behavioral psychology. I also started supporting Pine Crest students in their academic endeavors 

And here we are.
