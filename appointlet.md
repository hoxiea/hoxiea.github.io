For the Fall 2022 semester, I will be using <a href="https://appt.link/hamilton" target="_blank">Appointlet</a> for all my tutoring scheduling.

**(July 2022: If you have my Appointlet link saved from previous years, please update your bookmark with this new link. Enjoy the new and improved interface! ðŸ˜Ž)**

Appointlet:

* Shows my tutoring availability in real-time
* Lets you request sessions
* Sends you session reminder emails
* Handles changes/cancellations per my cancellation policy
* Respects other commitments on my calendar

This page explains the simple rules that Appointlet follows when managing my schedule. Knowledge of these rules will make it much easier for you to consistently book times that are convenient for you!

### 1. Appointlet offers sessions as soon as 12 hours ahead
If you realize after a long school day that you could use some help, you'll be able to get the help you need during an available time the following day - for example, at 10pm on a Tuesday, you'll be able to book a session as soon as 10am on Wednesday.

### 2. Appointlet offers sessions as far as two weeks ahead
For students with important assignments on the horizon or who just love planning ahead, Appointlet offers session times as far as two weeks in advance.

### 3. Cancel more than 24 hours before the session starts
With more than 24 hours until a session starts, you can use any Appointlet email for that session to reschedule or cancel, as the email explains:

<img src="/static/images/appointlet/cancel-resched-boxes-red-small.jpg" class="screenshot"/>

If you click either button and follow the prompts to completion,
* you'll receive an email confirming the change
* the time will be freed on my calendar
* you wonâ€™t be financially responsible for the time

With this simple interface, you can easily make changes to your sessions!


### 4. No canceling less than 24 hours before the session starts
Once weâ€™re within 24 hours of the session starting, the requested time is yours - congratulations!

You can still click the Cancel or Reschedule buttons from your email, but you'll see an error message:

<img src="/static/images/appointlet/failed-cancel-small.png" class="screenshot"/>

Because other students have been unable to request this time from the moment you requested it, you will be financially responsible for the time you booked, whether or not you're able to attend.

**Please note:** sessions can be requested with less than 24 hours to go, so if you're requesting a last-minute session, please make sure that you're interested and you have the times correct! You won't be able to cancel it once you've submitted your session request.

### 5. Reminder emails are sent in time to cancel
Once I've confirmed your request, you'll get reminder emails 48 and 72 hours before the session starts, giving you multiple chances to cancel if the time no longer works for you.


#### With a solid understanding of the rules that Appointlet uses to manage my schedule, I hope you'll be able to find times that work for you!

### Appendix: Faking A Weekly Time
Inspired by the frequent changes to reserved weekly times last year, I'll be discontinuing reserved weekly times as a scheduling experiment for the Fall 2022 semester.

I hope this new scheduling approach will mean that my Appointlet (un)availability reflects sessions that are highly likely to happen, versus sessions that will probably get changed/canceled with just 24-48 hours to go. This should make me more available to help my students succeed!

That said, if there's a timeslot when you'd like to work with me consistently, you could use the above policies to "fake" a reserved weekly time.

Suppose, for example, you wanted to work with me every Sunday 7-8pm, starting 9/4/2022. You could:

1. Request your first session (9/4 7-8pm) when it first becomes visible: exactly two weeks prior, on 8/21 at 8pm.
2. Request your second session (9/11 7-8pm) when it first becomes visible: exactly two weeks prior, on 8/28 at 8pm.
3. Request your third session (9/18 7-8pm) when it first becomes visible: exactly two weeks prior, on 9/4 at 8pm. **But 9/4 at 8pm is exactly when your first session ends!** So once we're done with our first session, take 30 seconds to visit [my Appointlet page](https://appt.link/hamilton) and request your preferred time in 2 weeks.
4. Request 9/25 7-8pm when it first becomes visible: exactly two weeks prior, on 9/11 at 8pm. **But 9/11 at 8pm is exactly when your second session ends!** Grab that future time!
5. (...repeat this process of booking exactly 2 weeks out for as long as it makes sense...)

So once you have those first two sessions booked, your desired timeslot (two weeks away) should become available at the moment each of our sessions end - you'll be in front of your computer, thinking about tutoring, and you can take a few seconds to request another session.

That said, I can't *guarantee* that your time will be available each week if you follow these steps. If it's unavailable, the most likely explanation is that I scheduled a conflicting personal event more than 2 weeks prior. I'll certainly try to avoid scheduling events during times that I know are popular with my students, but it might happen occasionally, in which case I appreciate your flexibility in finding another time temporarily until you can get back to your preferred time.
