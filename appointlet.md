For the Fall 2022 semester, I will be using [Appointlet](https://hamilton.appointlet.com) for all my tutoring scheduling.
Appointlet:

* Shows my tutoring availability in real-time
* Lets you request sessions at times that work for you
* Sends you reminder emails for booked sessions
* Handles changes/cancellations while respecting my cancellation policy
* Respects other commitments on my calendar

This page explains the simple rules that Appointlet follows when managing my schedule. Understanding these rules will make it much easier for you to consistently book times that are convenient for you.

### Appointlet offers sessions as soon as 12 hours ahead
If you realize after a long school day that you could use some help, you'll be able to get the help you need during an available time the following day.

### Appointlet offers sessions as far as 2 weeks ahead
For students with important assignments on the horizon or who just love planning ahead, Appointlet offers session times as far as two weeks in advance. (You may need to use the right arrow to find them, especially if you're using your phone, but they're there!)

### Cancel up to 24 hours before the session starts
With more than 24 hours until a session starts, you can use any Appointlet email for that session to reschedule or cancel.

After clicking this button, you'll see a summary of the session with buttons to Cancel and Reschedule:

If you click either button and follow the prompts,
* you'll receive an email confirming the change
* the time will be automatically freed on my calendar
* you won’t be financially responsible for the time

With this simple interface, you can make changes to your sessions without waiting for me!

### No canceling less than 24 hours before the session starts
Once we’re within 24 hours of the session starting, the requested time is yours - congratulations!

Clicking the "Cancel / Reschedule" button in an Appointlet email for the session will still take you to a summary of the session, but you *won't* see the options to Reschedule or Cancel:

<img src="/static/images/appointlet/no-cancel-reschedule-buttons.png" height="290"/>

Without those buttons,
* you can't Cancel or Reschedule the session
* you won't receive an email confirming the change because it didn't happen
* the time won't be freed from my calendar
* other students won't be able to request that time

For this last reason, you will be financially responsible for the time you booked, whether or not you're able to attend.

Please note that sessions can be requested with less than 24 hours to go, so if you're requesting a last-minute session, please make sure that you're really interested! You won't be able to cancel it once you've submitted your session request.

### Reminder emails are sent in time to cancel
Reminder emails are sent 48 and 72 hours before a session starts, giving you multiple opportunities to easily cancel your session if the time no longer works for you.


#### With a solid understanding of the rules that Appointlet uses to manage my schedule, I hope you'll be able to find times that work for you!

### Appendix: Faking A Weekly Time
Inspired by the high change/cancel rate I observed for reserved weekly times last year, I'll be discontinuing reserved weekly times as a scheduling experiment for the Fall 2022 semester.

I hope this new scheduling approach will mean that my Appointlet availability reflects sessions that are likely to happen, versus sessions that are likely to get changed or canceled with 24-72 hours to go. This should make me more available to help my students succeed!

That said, if there's a timeslot when you'd like to work with me consistently each week, you could use the above scheduling policies to "fake" your weekly time.

Suppose you wanted to work with me every Sunday 7-8pm, starting 9/4/2022. You could:

1. Request 9/4 7-8pm as soon as Appointlet offers it, exactly two weeks prior: 8/21 at 8pm.
2. Request 9/11 7-8pm as soon as Appointlet offers it, exactly two weeks prior: 8/28 at 8pm.
3. Request 9/18 7-8pm as soon as Appointlet offers it, exactly two weeks prior: 9/4 at 8pm. **But 9/4 at 8pm is exactly when your first session ends!** So once we're done with our first session, take 30 seconds to visit [my Appointlet page](https://hamilton.appointlet.com) and request your preferred time in 2 weeks.
4. Request 9/25 7-8pm as soon as Appointlet offers it, exactly two weeks prior: 9/11 at 8pm. **But 9/11 at 8pm is exactly when your second session ends!** Grab your future time!
5. (...repeat this process of booking exactly 2 weeks out for as long as it makes sense...)

So once you have those first two sessions booked, your desired timeslot (two weeks away) should become available at the moment each of our sessions end - you'll be in front of your computer, thinking about tutoring with Hamilton, and you can take a few seconds to request another excellent session.

That said, I can't *guarantee* that your time will be available each week if you follow these steps. If it's unavailable one week, the most likely explanation is that I scheduled a conflicting personal event more than 2 weeks prior. I'll certainly try to avoid scheduling events during times that I know are popular with my students, but it might happen occasionally, in which case I appreciate your flexibility in finding another time temporarily until you can get back to your preferred time.
