## Greetings!

I hope that this message finds you well. 2020 has been an incredibly tumultuous
year in many ways, and I sincerely hope that you, your family, and your loved
ones are safe.

Despite the tumult, one thing is certain: the educational show must go on. In
the fall, schools around the world will be doing their best to educate their
students in-person or remotely, and students will be expected to learn, grow,
and perform.

In the long run, this tumult will likely improve education. NYU Business
Professor [Scott Galloway](https://www.profgalloway.com/ "Scott Galloway: No
Mercy, No Malice") has been writing recently about how the events of 2020 might
impact higher education. My favorite optimistic Galloway prediction is that
world-class educational institutions will, after cutting costs by increasingly
transitioning to remote delivery, be able to provide their extraordinary
educational materials to much larger, wider audiences - surely an excellent
outcome for the human race.

I would also love to see a paradigm shift away from our current
memorization-based educational model (increasingly unimportant in the age of
computers) and towards a model that emphasizes critical thinking, problem
solving, effective communication, and other skills that cater to human
strengths, complemented by the incredible technologies available today.

But these changes will be years in the making, and the new school year is just
weeks away. If you're interesting in making the most of the coming educational
opportunities in the fall, you'll be pleased to hear that I'll be offering
academic support this year. 

However, academic support will work a bit differently this year, to accommodate
both the realities of 2020 and the fact that I'll be a remote student myself!
(I'm starting a Master's Degree in Computer Science via Georgia Tech's
[OMSCS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/ "OMSCS Home") program in the fall.)

Let's discuss those changes, which I sincerely hope will simultaneously enhance
the quality of academic support I'm able to provide and also streamline many
formerly tedious, time-consuming aspects of the academic support experience.


## Academic Support Changes for Next Year

### Change #1: Working **100% Remotely** With Students

I will be working **100% remotely** with students starting Fall 2020. There are
two main reasons for doing so:

#### A) Health/Safety

Social distancing has become the new normal. And it's remarkably difficult to
tutor in-person from 6 feet away! Wearing a mask for hours at a time isn't
comfortable or practical either, and you might not be quite so happy to see me
on your doorstep if I had already worked with five other students in five other
homes.

Thankfully, there's a safer way for students to work with tutors that also
happens to be more educationally effective: remote tutoring.

#### B) Remote Tutoring Is Better

At this point in my 13-year career, I've spent thousands of hours working with
students **in-person** (in Boston, Berkeley, and South Florida) and **remotely**
(ages 12-65, attending some of the best prep schools in the country, MIT, NYU,
UPenn/Wharton, BU, the London School of Economics, Pomona, Tulane, Miami, and
more).

In my professional opinion, remote tutoring is more educationally effective than
in-person tutoring in most cases. Why?

* My students are welcome to record our sessions locally and review the videos
  later.

* Each of my students has a shared Google Drive folder where they can upload
  material to be discussed ahead of time, and where screenshots from our sessions
  can be organized and saved digitally forever - never lose or accidentally throw away notes
  from a tutoring session again!

* The shared [digital whiteboard I use](https://awwapp.com/) lets me do
  things I can only dream of doing with pencil and paper:
  
  * Use colors to enhance the clarity of my explanations
  * Draw straight lines and perfect geometric shapes
  * Reorganize the position of work on the page 
  * Write out facts, theorems, etc. at full typing speed (140 wpm)
  * Examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

TODO: find nice screenshot examples, upload to hhackerman.com, and link above

* Students can clearly see what I'm writing on our shared digital whiteboard
  (without my hand/arm blocking their view). They can also interact with the
  whiteboard the way we would in-person: writing things, pointing to
  something when asking a question, etc.

I have worked remotely with students young and old across a wide range of
subjects and time zones, and it works. (It's also environmentally
friendlier! :pencil: :deciduous_tree: :x:)


### Change #2: Streamlined Scheduling and Availability

Working 100% remotely should make scheduling simpler for everyone.

In particular, I'll be using a web-based scheduling program called Appointlet to
automate the scheduling process as much as possible. This year, Appointlet
should let you:

* Immediately see when I'm available for academic support
* Book academic support sessions with me
* Reschedule and cancel existing sessions

No more waiting to hear back from me. No more back-and-forth messages about who's
available when. [My Appointlet page](https://hamilton.appointlet.com/
"Hamilton's Appointlet page") has the answers, and it's available online 24/7.

There will be two options for working with me next year:

#### Option 1: Recurring Sessions
Some students prefer to use my services with unwavering predictability on a
weekly basis: Sundays from 1-2pm, Thursdays from 7-9pm, etc.

If you like this approach, let's [discuss your
situation](mailto:ftlaudmathtutor@gmail.com) so that we can find a routine
that's likely to work consistently for everyone. Then we'll plug it into
Appointlet so that you can make changes when the usual plan won't quite work.

If you wish to book extra sessions in addition to your recurring session(s), or
your schedule isn't quite so predictable, you should try...

#### Option 2: Individual Sessions
To book individual sessions with me, head over to [my Appointlet booking
page](https://hamilton.appointlet.com/ "Hamilton's Appointlet page") and pick a
time!

Appointlet should always display up-to-date availability, so if you see a time
that works for you, book it! (Make sure to check out my suggestions for working
effectively with Appointlet.)

TODO: write Appointlet guide, then link to it


### Change #3: Formalized Policies and Procedures

Whether we have a recurring session or you're booking sessions with me as you
need them, my Appointlet page will give you real-time access to my schedule. And
the emails and calendar events you receive from Appointlet will let you manage
your booked sessions.

Appointlet will also be automatically enforcing certain scheduling policies and
expectations, which change depending on how far in advance you're acting:

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Time Until Session</th>
      <th>Options and Expectations</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">48+ hours</td>
      <td align="left">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Book:</strong> Appointlet offers all my available
  sessions with start times more than 48 hours away. I won't be able to accommodate
  last-minute booking requests this year because of the increased demands on my
  time and attention as a Master's student - please plan ahead and then take your pick!</li>
          <li><strong>Reschedule:</strong> Change an existing session to a different, available time that's at
  least 48 hours away, free of charge.</li>
          <li><strong>Cancel:</strong> Change of plans? No problem! Use your
  confirmation email or calendar event to cancel, free of charge.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">24-48 hours</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reschedule:</strong> Change an existing session to a new available time that's at least 48 hours away, free of charge.</li>
          <li><strong>Cancel:</strong> No longer need help? No problem! Use your
  confirmation email or calendar event to cancel, free of charge.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">0-24 hours</td>
      <td>
          At this point, I will have organized my personal, professional, and
  educational lives to give you my undivided attention and expertise at the time you
  requested. In exchange, you'll be responsible for the full cost of the session
  you booked, whether the student is able to attend or not.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

These policies are designed to give you as much flexibility as possible while
allowing me to budget my time and know my busiest-possible tutoring schedule 48
hours in advance. As a full-time student, I unfortunately won't be able to
accommodate anything more urgent than that this year.

## Looking Forward

I hope that you enjoy the rest of your summer and that your coming year is safe,
productive, and successful. If you've decided that you'd like me to play a role
in that success, I look forward to working with you and helping you or your
children achieve their full potential!

Best wishes,<br>
Hamilton
